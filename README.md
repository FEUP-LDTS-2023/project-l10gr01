## LDTS_<10><01> - <Universe Bomber>


Our game was inspired by the classic game Bomberman, in which the protagonist uses his bombs to clear the path and destroy monsters. The version proposed by us is themed by the Steven Universe cartoon, that has Steven as a half gem boy who is a faced with a challenge to save his friends who were captured by evil gems. They were taken to a tricky maze filled with monsters and obstacles which Steven has to go through to free them. Along his path, our hero encounters new exciting power-ups to help in his mission. In each difficulty levels, he is faced with more powerfull monsters and paths. 


This project was developed by Leonardo Garcia (up202200041@up.pt), Marcel Medeiros (up202200042@up.pt) and Manoela Blanke (up202201392@up.pt) for LDTS 2023⁄24.

### IMPLEMENTED FEATURES

> This far only the model and the view of the game are implemented. More will come with upcoming commits!

### PLANNED FEATURES

-> **Monsters** : In this game Steven Universe is faced with different enemies. In each difficulty level, a monster will be presented and copies of him will be placed in the maze. A monster's objectivity is to catch Steven and damage him, making him lose his lifes. 

-> **Deploy Bombs** : Steven (our hero) is able to deploy gem bombs. These bombs can destroy certain wall types and kill monsters. This is a default feature, which means that steven will always have this ability, however after deploying a bombing Steven has to recharge in order to deploy another one.

-> **Gain Lifes** : Steven starts the game with a maximum of 3 lifes, along his path he may lost these lifes (either by standing next to a bomb or fighiting a monster). More lifes are hidden in the walls, by exploding a wall, Steven may find those lifes and take a safer adventure. 

-> **10X Bomb Upgrade** : by finding this bomb upgrade Steven will be able to temporarily enlarge the radius of bomb damage by 10x. 

-> **Unlimited Bombs Upgrade** : by finding this bomb upgrade, Steven will be able to temporarily deploy an unlimited amount of bombs, without waiting his power to recharge.

**Examples**:

- **Jumping** - The game character will jump when the space bar key is pressed.
- **Getting hidden coins** - When the game character hits a platform from below (by jumping beneath it) it will smash that segment of the platform and will get any coins that may exist hidden there.
